                GNU social is a continuation of the StatusNet project. 
                It is a social communication software for public and private 
                communications. It is widely supported and has a large userbase 
                including the <a href="https://status.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>.
            <p>
                GNU social connects you to a free network of thousands of communities that discuss daily on a variety of topics, each being part of the whole.
